# MATLAB Analysis of Power Plant

## Overview
This repository contains MATLAB scripts and data files for analyzing power plant data. The analysis includes data handling, visualization, model development, and advanced modeling techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

## Features
- **Data Handling and Visualization:** Import data, segregate variables, and generate scatterplots.
- **Model Development and Evaluation:** Develop linear regression models, compute coefficients, and evaluate using RMSE.
- **Advanced Modeling:** Construct comprehensive linear models and explore non-linear relationships.
- **PCA:** Execute PCA to understand data structure and dimensionality reduction.
